@article{VERHAEGEN1992,
abstract = {In this paper, we present two novel algorithms to realize a finite dimensional, linear time-invariant state-space model from input-output data. The algorithms have a number of common features. They are classified as one of the subspace model identification schemes, in that a major part of the identification problem consists of calculating specially structured subspaces of spaces defined by the input-output data. This structure is then exploited in the calculation of a realization. Another common feature is their algorithmic organization: an RQ factorization followed by a singular value decomposition and the solution of an overdetermined set (or sets) of equations. The schemes assume that the underlying system has an output-error structure and that a measurable input sequence is available. The latter characteristic indicates that both schemes are versions of the MIMO Output-Error State Space model identification (MOESP) approach. The first algorithm is denoted in particular as the (elementary MOESP scheme)...},

abstract = {This paper addresses the detection and isolation of replay attacks on sensor measurements. As opposed to previously proposed additive watermarking, we propose a multiplicative watermarking scheme, where each sensor's output is separately watermarked by being fed to a SISO watermark generator. Additionally, a set of equalizing filters is placed at the controller's side, which reconstructs the original output signals from the received watermarked data. We show that the proposed scheme has several advantages over existing approaches: it has no detrimental effects on the closed-loop performance in the absence of attacks; it can be designed in a modular fashion, independently of the design of the controller and anomaly detector; it facilitates the detection of replay attacks and the isolation of the time at which the replayed data was recorded. These properties are discussed in detail and the results are illustrated through a numerical example.},
